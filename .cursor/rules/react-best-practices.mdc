# React Best Practices

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Create proper component composition with children props
- Implement proper prop drilling prevention with Context or state management
- Use proper naming conventions for components (PascalCase)

## Hooks Usage
- Follow the Rules of Hooks (only call at the top level)
- Create custom hooks for reusable logic
- Use useCallback for functions passed to child components
- Implement useMemo for expensive calculations
- Use proper dependency arrays in useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback

## Performance Optimization
- Implement React.memo for pure functional components
- Use proper key props in lists with stable identifiers
- Avoid anonymous functions in render methods
- Implement proper code splitting with dynamic imports
- Use the useTransition hook for non-blocking updates

## State Management
- Use useState for local component state
- Implement useReducer for complex state logic
- Use Context API for shared state across components
- Implement proper state normalization for complex data
- Consider React Query for server state management

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries for component trees
- Use try/catch in async operations
- Create fallback UI for error states
- Implement proper logging for errors
- Use React Error Boundary components

## React Server Components (RSC)
- Use Server Components for data fetching and server-side operations
- Implement proper boundary between Server and Client Components
- Use "use client" directive appropriately
- Leverage streaming with Suspense boundaries
- Implement proper loading states with Suspense

## Accessibility
- Implement proper semantic HTML elements
- Use ARIA attributes when necessary
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Implement proper focus management
- Test with screen readers and accessibility tools
