# Firebase Best Practices

## Authentication
- Use Firebase Authentication for user management and role-based access
- Implement proper session management and token refresh
- Use custom claims for role-based authorization
- Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Follow the principle of least privilege for user permissions

## Firestore
- Design schema for query efficiency and avoid nested collections when possible
- Implement proper security rules with thorough testing
- Use batched writes and transactions for related operations
- Create proper indexes for complex queries
- Implement efficient pagination with cursor-based approaches
- Minimize document size by referencing related documents instead of embedding

## Firebase Functions
- Use Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Create proper unit tests for cloud functions
- Implement proper rate limiting and quota management
- Use TypeScript for type safety in function development

## Realtime Features
- Use onSnapshot listeners efficiently with proper query parameters
- Unsubscribe from listeners when components unmount
- Implement optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Use Firebase Analytics for tracking user behavior
- Implement proper error handling for realtime data changes

## Security
- Implement thorough Firestore security rules with unit tests
- Use Firebase App Check to prevent abuse
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- Implement proper CORS configuration for Functions
- Use Firebase Security Rules Simulator for testing
- Keep sensitive operations in secure backend environments

## Performance
- Implement proper data caching with React Query
- Use Firebase Performance Monitoring 
- Optimize image uploads and downloads with Firebase Storage
- Implement proper indexing for frequently queried fields
- Monitor usage to stay within Firebase free tier limits when possible
