# Firebase Best Practices for AKW Racing Academy

## Firebase Setup

The application uses Firebase for:
- Authentication
- Firestore database
- Cloud Storage
- Cloud Functions

The Firebase configuration is in `lib/firebase.ts`.

## Authentication

- Use the Firebase Authentication service in `lib/auth.ts`
- Implement proper authentication flows for different user types:
  - Students/Parents
  - Instructors
  - Administrators
- Protect routes using the `middleware.ts` at the application root
- Use custom claims for role-based access control

## Firestore Database

- Follow the data model defined in the application
- Main collections:
  - `users`: User profiles
  - `courses`: Racing course offerings
  - `enrollments`: Student course enrollments
  - `instructors`: Racing instructors
  - `facilities`: Racing facilities and tracks
  - `equipment`: Racing equipment inventory
- Use subcollections for hierarchical data
- Apply security rules defined in `firestore.rules`

## Cloud Storage

- Store user-uploaded content in Firebase Storage
- Organize files in appropriate folders:
  - `/users/{userId}/`: User-specific files
  - `/courses/{courseId}/`: Course-related files
  - `/instructors/{instructorId}/`: Instructor files
  - `/facilities/{facilityId}/`: Facility images
- Apply security rules defined in `storage.rules`

## Security Rules

- Always implement proper security rules
- Use Firebase Authentication for user identification
- Validate data in security rules when possible
- Test security rules thoroughly

## Data Access Patterns

- Use service functions in `lib/services/` to abstract Firebase operations
- Implement pagination for large collections
- Use composite indexes for complex queries (defined in `firestore.indexes.json`)
- Cache frequently accessed data with React Query

## Deployment

- Use Firebase Hosting for serverless functions
- Configure proper environment variables
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for deployment
