- Enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json` for better type checking
- Use interfaces for object shapes and types for utility types
- Leverage type guards and assertions for runtime type checking
- Implement generics for reusable components and functions
- Use strict null checks
- Prefer interface over type when possible
- Use type guards and assertions for runtime type checking
- Implement proper type inference
- Use enums for a set of named constants
